# Stock Analysis

## Overview of the Project

Steve who is recently graduated with his finance degree, wanted to look into Daqo stocks for his parents, but he is concerned about diversifying their funds. He wants to analyze a handful of green energy stocks in addition to Daqo's stock and for that he has created an excel file containing the stock data he wants to analyze.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve understand the market trends. Macros are created in VBA to analyze the stock data that would be easily accessible for Steve. Also, total daily volume and yearly return is identified for each of the twelve stocks for the years 2017 and 2018. Interface is created so that at the click of a button, Steve can analyze an entire dataset. During the analysis two macros are created, the original script which was created from the module, and a refactored version of that script to determine whether refactoring the code made the VBA script run faster.

## Results

### Stock analysis performance between 2017 and 2018

### Comparision between execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary

### The advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code

### How does pros and Cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script
