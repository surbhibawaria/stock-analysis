# Stock Analysis

## Overview of the Project

Steve who is recently graduated with his finance degree, wanted to look into Daqo stocks for his parents, but he is concerned about diversifying their funds. He wants to analyze a handful of green energy stocks in addition to Daqo's stock and for that he has created an excel file containing the stock data he wants to analyze.

### Purpose and Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve understand the market trends. Also, to do a little more research for his parents, as Steve wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. And to refactor the code so that it doesn't take a long time to execute.

Macros are created in VBA to analyze the stock data that would be easily accessible for Steve. Total daily volume and yearly return is identified for each of the twelve stocks for the years 2017 and 2018. Conditional formatting is used to highlight the positive (Green) and negative (Red) returns. Interface is created so that at the click of a button, Steve can analyze an entire dataset. During the analysis two macros are created, the original script which was created from the module, and a refactored version of that script to determine whether refactoring the code made the VBA script run faster.

## Results

The stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script are compared.


### Stock analysis performance of 2017 vs 2018

For 2017, it can be seen that eleven out of the twelve stocks are positive and only one stock ticker 'TERP' is negative in terms of the yearly return.
